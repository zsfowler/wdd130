                <h2>Seismograph Sencer</h2>
                <p class="text-1-seis">The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization is an international organization that will be established upon the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, a Convention that outlaws nuclear test explosions. Its seat will be Vienna, Austria. The organization will be tasked with verifying the ban on nuclear tests and will operate therefore a worldwide monitoring system and may conduct on site inspections. The Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO, and its Provisional Technical Secretariat, were established in 1997 and are headquartered in Vienna, Austria.‚Äù</p>
                <h3>Seismograph Server</h3>
                <p class="text-2-seis">Tuckaleechee Caverns hosts the most sensitive seismic station on Earth. It was originally installed by TVA when they began the construction of the TVA dams to see what the displacement of water would do to the tectonic plates in the area. The Cuban missile crisis occurred as the US military was discovering how accurate and precise the station tracks the global tectonic movement all around the Earth. The US military began upgrading it from then on to utilize the station to detect nuclear testing across the globe. Tuckaleechee Caverns AS107 seismic station is now monitored 24-7 and is transmitted via satellite to the DOD, US military, Geneva Switzerland, Vienna Austria, CTBTO and the Pentagon within 300ths of a millisecond.</p>
