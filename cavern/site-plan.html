        Tuckaleechee Caverns of Townsend, TN. Known as the “Greatest Site Under the Smokies” are the highest rating Cave or Cavern of the Eastern United States. Carved inside the earth’s oldest mountain chain and estimated to be between twenty to thirty million years old, the Caverns are rich in history and lore in recent years as well. You will find the “BigRoom” on one end of the tour that could almost fit a football stadium inside it. On the other half of the tour you get to view “SilverFalls”. It falls 210 feet from top to bottom and the tallest subterranean waterfall in the Eastern US . Millions of formations are viewed along the 1.25 mile round trip adventure.

      <h3>Seismograph</h3>
      <p>
        Tuckaleechee Caverns hosts the most sensitive seismic station on Earth. It was originally installed by TVA when they began the construction of the TVA dams to see what the displacement of water would do to the tectonic plates in the area. The Cuban missile crisis occurred as the US military was discovering how accurate and precise the station tracks the global tectonic movement all around the Earth. The US military began upgrading it from then on to utilize the station to detect nuclear testing across the globe. Tuckaleechee Caverns AS107 seismic station is now monitored 24-7 and is transmitted via satellite to the DOD, US military, Geneva Switzerland, Vienna Austria, CTBTO and the Pentagon within 300ths of a millisecond.

        (CTBTO) Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization
        The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization is an international organization that will be established upon the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, a Convention that outlaws nuclear test explosions. Its seat will be Vienna, Austria. The organization will be tasked with verifying the ban on nuclear tests and will operate therefore a worldwide monitoring system and may conduct on site inspections. The Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO, and its Provisional Technical Secretariat, were established in 1997 and are headquartered in Vienna, Austria.”

      <h3>Formations</h3>
      <p>
        Cave formations are commonly known as “cave onyx.” It is a form of calcium carbonate which is the same material of which limestone is made. Its only value is the beauty it adds to the cave.

        It is brittle and will break like glass. The acid from the touch of one’s hand to cave onyx will destroy the gloss on it and make it dull and unattractive.

        Cave onyx is formed by surface water which combines with carbon dioxide which is given off by plants, and forms a mild carbonic acid. The acid dissolves limestone rock (calcium carbonate) and forms calcium bicarbonate which is soluable in water. This solution seeps down into the cave.

        The limestone will stay in bicarbonate form only as long as the carbon dioxide is present. Since carbon dioxide is normally a gas, it takes pressure and low temperature to keep it in the solution.

        This pressure is furnished by the ground as the solution seeps through and the coolness is furnished by the natural coolness of the earth.

        When this bicarbonate solution reaches the cave ceiling, the pressure is relieved and the solution warms up. This releases the carbon dioxide and the calcium bicarbonate turns back to plain old calcium carbonate which is not soluable in water so it is deposited on the cave ceiling or floor in the form of cave onyx.

        The rate of drip is an important factor in the rate of growth and shape of the formation. If the drip is slow, most of the deposit is left on the ceiling. If it is fast, the major deposit is left on the floor. A slow drip makes faster growth than fast drip.

        The average growth of formations is about one cubic inch per 100 years!
